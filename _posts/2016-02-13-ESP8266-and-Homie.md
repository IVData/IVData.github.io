Home automation and living in New Zealand really dont mix. Some home automation products have come onto the market here in the last few weeks, but are hilariously expensive:

Sure you can buy wifi lightswitches etc on Amazon or Ebay, but the vast majority are 110V, only US rated, or a different size/shape to our switches here. You can buy smart switches at the same retailer as the picture above too - but they're completely wireless (battery powered) so you can't connect them to your actual wiring, and you need to buy a smart lightbulb from the same company at $75 a pop. Then I guess you have a bunch of redundant and confusing lightswitches and wiring in your house? What the actual fuck.
