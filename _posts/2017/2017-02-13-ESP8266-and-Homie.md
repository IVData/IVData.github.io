Home automation and living in New Zealand really dont mix. Some home automation products have come onto the market here in the last few weeks, but are hilariously expensive:

Sure you can buy wifi lightswitches etc on Amazon or Ebay, but the vast majority are 110V, only US rated, or a different size/shape to our switches here. You can buy smart switches at the same retailer as the picture above too - but they're completely wireless (battery powered) so you can't connect them to your actual wiring, and you need to buy a smart lightbulb from the same company at $75 a pop. Then I guess you have a bunch of redundant and confusing lightswitches and wiring in your house? What the actual fuck.


## Enter the ESP8266

These have been out for a while now - they're a little wifi chip + micro controller you can pick up for a few bucks ([read more about the ESP here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266)).

The thing that I didn't like when these came out was the lack of documentation and the complexity of programming them. Now however, some wonderful people have built [an arduino IDE library](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) to make the process of programming and flashing much easier - and it works really well. The ESP has 2.0mm pitch pads on it, so I bought some proto-board and made this flashing board:

The big switch is there to change between boot modes (flashing or running), and the pin holes on the ESP are tight enough that the ESP makes full contact without securing it in any way. I was blinking LEDs in no time with this!

Yes I know you can buy 433mhz transmitters and receivers for a few bucks too. But they're quite insecure unless you design your own protocol that's secure (which no, you can't) and with the price of the microcontroller to drive them, you've probably already spent more than an ESP costs.

So now I can go ahead and start building some IoT devices with my ESPs - cool. Plus, I wont need any extra equipment like a z-wave bridge, because all of my computers and server are already connected to the LAN already. But how will these IoT devices speak to each other?


## MQTT, Homie

[MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) is a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging protocol designed for the IoT. That means, you can 'subscribe' to a topic (like the weather, or a lightbulb's status) and you will receive messages about it. You can also 'publish' on your own topics, and people subscribed to them will receive your messages. A 'broker' server handles all of the passing on of messages - I set up [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) in a [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto/).

[Homie is a lightweight MQTT convention for the IoT](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie). What that means is, it's like a standard for how IoT devices should conduct themselves. IMO, standards are a very good idea when done well. You will notice there is no code in the link abov for Homie. Homie by itself is abstract - it is just a collection of rules you should follow. Well how to put it to use?

Luckily, some genius who goes by the name marvinroger wrote [homie-esp8266](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266). This is an implementation of Homie that is an arduino library, and runs on the ESP. Check out the features list for awesome things like Over-The-Air updates - that is, flashing new firmware wirelessly. Also included on that page is a very simple example sketch for a smart light. What this means is, with literally a few lines of code your can have a wireless IoT device that you can update remotely, query it's current status, firmware version, signal strength, and its capabilities for controlling devices. What's more, [Homie-OTA](https://github.com/jpmens/homie-ota) is a thing, which shows you a nice list of all of your Homie devices and will handle firmware upgrades for you!

The sky really is the limit here. You can have a new remotely upgradable IoT device with pins to control stuff or read sensors in a few minutes. In the last few weeks I've made my own RGB lamp, smart lightswitch, and garage door opener that are all Homie devices. But more on those later =)
